Question 1
Your code uses a few functions in the math module here and there, but you also tend to use the sin, cos and tan functions and the pi constant very frequently.

Write some import statements that you think would be helpful in this scenario.

Question 2
There is a library that we installed for our course called matplotlib.

We can certainly import that library using its full name, but whenever we need to reach into that module we need to type out matplotlib.som_func - since we use this library quite often, typing out matplotlib every time gets tiring.

Write an import function that allows you to reference that module using the name mpl instead of the full name matplotlib.
