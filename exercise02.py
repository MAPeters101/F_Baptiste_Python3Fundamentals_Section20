Question 2
There is a library that we installed for our course called matplotlib.

We can certainly import that library using its full name, but whenever we need
to reach into that module we need to type out matplotlib.som_func - since we
use this library quite often, typing out matplotlib every time gets tiring.

Write an import function that allows you to reference that module using the
name mpl instead of the full name matplotlib.
